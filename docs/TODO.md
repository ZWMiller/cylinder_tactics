# Cylinder Tactics — TODO

A 2D-feel, isometric, turn-based tactics game (FF Tactics clone), built in 3D
with an orthographic camera. Characters are cylinders; terrain is boxes.
Workflow: **code-driven** (generate grid/terrain/units from data in GDScript).

## Done
- [x] Base scene (`scenes/Main.tscn`): environment, light, ortho camera, box, cylinder
- [x] Fixed black screen — camera basis was transposed, so it faced away from the scene

## Next
- [ ] `Battlefield.gd` — generate terrain from a 2D array of tile heights (boxes at correct x/z, varying Z height)
- [ ] `Unit` scene + script — cylinder that knows its grid coordinate
- [ ] Grid <-> world coordinate helpers (tile -> world position, click -> tile)

## Later / backlog
- [ ] Tile selection + highlight on hover/click
- [ ] Unit movement tile-to-tile (with movement range based on grid distance + Z cost)
- [ ] Turn order / turn-based loop
- [ ] Multiple grid sizes
- [ ] Basic combat (attack range, damage)

## Notes / things learned
- A camera looks down its own -Z axis. A transposed rotation matrix = inverse
  rotation, which silently aims the camera the wrong way (classic black-screen bug).
- Prefer setting Position/Rotation separately, or `look_at(Vector3.ZERO, Vector3.UP)`
  in code, instead of hand-writing `Transform3D(...)` matrices.
- Godot ignores unrecognized files (like this one). Drop an empty `.gdignore` in a
  folder to make Godot skip it entirely.
