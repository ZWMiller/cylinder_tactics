# Cylinder Tactics — TODO

A 2D-feel, isometric, turn-based tactics game (FF Tactics clone), built in 3D
with an orthographic camera. Characters are cylinders; terrain is boxes.
Workflow: **code-driven** (generate grid/terrain/units from data in GDScript).

## Done
- [x] Base scene (`scenes/Main.tscn`): environment, light, ortho camera, box, cylinder
- [x] Fixed black screen — camera basis was transposed, so it faced away from the scene
- [x] `Battlefield.gd` — code-driven 24×24 grid of (height, type) tiles, geometry-only
      (brown earth columns + colored caps), centered on origin. See `docs/BATTLEFIELD.md`
- [x] Time-shift v1 — map is a *sequence* of states; Space cycles grassland→canyon→desert
      via the small shift API (`peek_next_state` / `advance_shift`). `scripts/maps/DemoMap.gd`
- [x] `TileTypes.gd` — terrain enum + flat-color palette (shared vocabulary)
- [x] `Unit` scene + script — cylinder body (color = allegiance) + per-class hat
      (square/pyramid/cone = soldier/archer/mage). Hybrid scene+script; per-instance
      materials so units reskin independently. `UnitClasses.gd` = class table.
      Demo units spawn via `Main.gd`. See `docs/UNIT.md`
- [x] Click→tile picking — per-tile collision box (tagged with `grid_coord` meta) +
      `Battlefield.tile_at_screen_point()` physics raycast (height-correct). Decided
      *not* to extract a separate coordinate module; helpers stay on `Battlefield`
      (the coordinate authority). See `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` 2026-06-19.
- [x] Click-to-move units — single `_active_unit` pointer (the turn-order seam; Tab
      cycles it as a stand-in), tile-occupancy map, active-unit highlight.
      `Unit.grid_coord` now drives placement. See DECISION_LOG.
- [x] Stepped, tile-by-tile movement (no diagonals) — units walk the route bumping
      up/down to each tile's height instead of floating in a straight line. Right-click
      adds waypoints, mouse-move previews the lit-up path, left-click commits, Escape
      clears. `Battlefield.expand_path` / `path_to_world_points` / `show_path`,
      `Unit.move_along`. Per-step heights exposed for the future jump gate. See DECISION_LOG.
- [x] Per-turn action menu — bottom-left HUD (`ActionMenu.gd`, a CanvasLayer view)
      with Move / End Turn; Up/Down highlight, Enter activates. Input is gated by a
      `Phase` enum in `Main` (MENU vs MOVE): movement only works after choosing Move;
      End Turn cycles the active unit. See DECISION_LOG.

## Next
- [ ] **Jump-height gate** — the hook is ready: reject a move when any
      `Battlefield.path_step_heights(path)` step exceeds the unit's jump stat (needs the
      stat block below). Tint the preview red / refuse the commit when illegal.
- [ ] Movement range limit — clicks currently move the active unit *anywhere*; gate by
      grid distance + Z cost (Battlefield helpers are the place for reachability)
- [ ] Class-driven stat blocks — `UnitClasses.gd` is the intended home (GAME_DESIGN §2–3);
      feeds movement range (move/jump) and turn order (speed)
- [ ] Turn order / turn-based loop — will *set* `_active_unit` from speed/initiative,
      replacing the temporary Tab cycle
- [ ] Re-settle units + apply fall damage inside `advance_shift()` (currently terrain-only;
      units don't move when the map shifts yet) — occupancy map now exists in `Main`

## Polish / nice-to-have
- [ ] Distinguish committed-waypoint tiles from the hover tail in the path preview
      (e.g. a stronger color), and maybe a destination marker
- [ ] Tune `Unit.MOVE_SPEED` and the step cadence once real maps exist

## Later / backlog
- [ ] Tile selection + highlight on hover/click
- [ ] Unit movement tile-to-tile (with movement range based on grid distance + Z cost)
- [ ] Turn order / turn-based loop
- [ ] Multiple grid sizes
- [ ] Basic combat (attack range, damage)
- [ ] Character classes (soldier/archer/mage) + class-driven stat blocks — see `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` §2–3
- [ ] Time-degradation map shift every N turns (tiles drop, units fall + take damage) — see `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` §4
- [ ] Shift telegraph + hold-to-preview "what-if" view — see `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` §4
- [ ] Time-mage powers (accelerate shift, shift one tile early, …) — deferred, see `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` §5

See `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` for the full game-design vision and the structural choices
to respect now (maps as height *sequences*, a shift API, data-driven stats).

## Owner onboarding / learning (revisit next session)
- [x] **Line-by-line walkthrough of Godot's invocation pattern**, using "place one
      unit" (player archer at tile 12,10) as the worked example. Mapped each step to
      exact lines: `Main.gd:12` `preload` (parse-time blueprint) -> `:41`
      `instantiate()` (the `new`, no `_ready` yet) -> `:44` `configure` stashes
      identity (guarded by `is_node_ready()` in `Unit.gd:61`) -> `:46` `add_child` is
      the seam that fires `Unit._ready` (`Unit.gd:49`) -> `_apply_appearance`/`_layout`
      read the fields, swap the hat mesh via `UnitClasses.new_hat_mesh`, build
      per-unit materials -> `:47` `tile_to_world` places it -> engine draws every
      frame (no explicit render call). Key takeaway: `add_child` is the boundary
      between "constructing data" and "engine owns the lifecycle."
      - Analogies that landed: PackedScene ≈ class blueprint/prefab you clone;
        `_ready` ≈ engine-invoked constructor-ish hook; `UnitClasses` statics ≈ a
        module of free functions.

## Notes / things learned
- A camera looks down its own -Z axis. A transposed rotation matrix = inverse
  rotation, which silently aims the camera the wrong way (classic black-screen bug).
- Prefer setting Position/Rotation separately, or `look_at(Vector3.ZERO, Vector3.UP)`
  in code, instead of hand-writing `Transform3D(...)` matrices.
- Godot ignores unrecognized files (like this one). Drop an empty `.gdignore` in a
  folder to make Godot skip it entirely.
