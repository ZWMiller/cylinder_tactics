# Decision Log

A running record of critical, hard-to-reverse, or non-obvious decisions made
during Cylinder Tactics. Newest entries at the top. Each entry: the decision,
why, and any alternatives rejected.

## 2026-06-17 — Documentation & workflow conventions

**Decision:** Heavy documentation discipline. Every function gets a docstring
(regardless of simplicity); complex steps in functions and config files get
explanatory comments; components get written up in markdown under `docs/` as we
build them. Discuss and plan multi-step or unclear work before coding.

**Why:** Owner strongly prefers thorough documentation and design discussion over
jumping straight to code.

## 2026-06-17 — Code-driven scene construction

**Decision:** Build the grid, terrain, and units from data in GDScript at runtime
rather than hand-placing nodes in the Godot editor.

**Why:** Tactics maps vary in size and per-tile height; generating from a data
array scales far better than manual placement and keeps maps as editable data.

**Rejected:** GUI/Inspector-first scene building — fine for learning individual
nodes, but doesn't scale to procedural maps.

## 2026-06-17 — 3D with an orthographic camera

**Decision:** Render the isometric, 2D-feeling battlefield using a 3D scene with
an orthographic camera, not Godot's 2D engine.

**Why:** Terrain needs real Z-height variation and an isometric look; 3D + ortho
gives true height and depth handling for free, while 2D would require faking it.

**Note:** A camera looks down its own -Z axis. Hand-written `Transform3D` bases are
error-prone (a transpose silently aims the camera away — the original black-screen
bug). Prefer Position/Rotation fields or `look_at()`.
